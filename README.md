## What is a Social Media Browser?

Most social media sites are "bundled" as a single app, which controls what creators can post, how content is distributed, and how the media is consumed.

The problem is that social media businesses focus on profits, so they game the users to spend as much time on site as possible and watching anything that keeps them hooked.  The resulting addictive behaviors and exposure to possibly harmful content results in mental health issues.

A social media browser is an "unbundled" app.  Just as a web browser, like Chrome or Safari, allows you to browse any website, a social media browser allows you to watch social media from any source.  Users can select a social media browser that respects their sensibilities, such as time limits to browsing, or to filter certain kinds of content.
